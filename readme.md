-> FIRST I'LL DO STEP 1, THEN STEP 2 AND FINALLY STEP 3 !

## STEP 1: RESTAURANTS

	1. Get user's location with leaflet geoloc [done]

	2. Specific color marker on that location  [done]

	3. Put focus on user's location [done]

	4. If restaurants aren't visible, don't put them in the menu. Else show them in the menu [almost done]

	5. When you click on a restaurant, show its google street view photo [Issues with integration of API]

	6. Filter tool display restaurant b/w X and Y stars. [almost done]

## STEP 2: ADD RESTAURANTS AND REVIEWS

	7. Add a review to existing restaurants (onclick event) / create a form, essentially

	8. Create a new restaurant when clicking on the map 
	
	[not necessary to keep the info after user leaves the page]

## STEP 3: INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE PLACES API

	9. Find an API to retrieve restaurants and reviews! Use it to display additional restaurants and reviews on your map so you don't have to use only your JSON file.
